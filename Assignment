        To avoid the security issues.
        there is no need to believe third party.
  	To make the data immutable.

3,  What are the few features that blockchain will give you?

	1)verifiable 
	2)Tamper-proof
	3)Immutable
	4)No hacking 
	5)Huge security
	6)Verified data
	7)Data transparency
	8)Decentralized

4,  What all things do a block contains?
       
  	1)data.
	2)current SHA-key.
	3)previous SHA_key.
	4)block number.
 
5,  How all the verifiability of blockchain is been attained?

        Blockchain use distributed database and hashkey(cryptography). so we can verify by comparing with other database's hashkey.
